<!--should this page say more about why the game is called Ivanhoe? maybe another quotation from Jerry RE: the multiplicity of Ivanhoe reading or something? Also. how about some images? Finally, is it a good idea to show our hand and say what we want to do? Seems very ambitious.-->

<h1>History of Ivanhoe</h1>
<p>
Ivanhoe has experienced a series of transformations, as concept as well as software. Its trajectory reflects the work of several scholars, 
the collaboration of different institutions, and the engagement of many disciplinary communities through time. <!--can put a link about contributors acknowledged.J.Gj.-->

<h2> Past • Present • Future </h2>

<p>
Ivanhoe builds on the past. The name comes from Sir Walter Scott's novel <i>Ivanhoe</i> which was the cultural object of interest 
at the center of the first game played in the year 2000 by scholars Johanna Drucker and Jerome McGann. The initial goal of the game was
to uncover alternative narratives and readings by intervening directly in the text: adding to it, reordering the plot, or deleting scenes or
characters. The first version of the game was played by sending new versions of the text back and forth via email. For more on the logic behind
Ivanhoe as a concept, see a 2004 article by Jerome McGann, Johanna Drucker, and Bethany Nowviskie: <a href="http://www.rc.umd.edu/pedagogies/commons/innovations/IVANHOE.html#session">"IVANHOE: Education in a New Key."</a>
</p>
  
<p>
The concept of Ivanhoe caught on, and soon dozens of Ivanhoe games were being played at the University of Virginia and <a href="http://texttechnology.mcmaster.ca/pdf/vol12_2_04.pdf">elsewhere</a>. 
Faculty, graduate students, and software developers at UVa's <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/SpecLab.html?id=VPXCk396uPYC">SpecLab</a> think-tank and 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_Research_in_Patacriticism">ARP lab</a>—two precursors to the UVa Library <a href="praxis.scholarslab.org">Praxis Program</a> and 
<a href="http://www.scholarslab.org">Scholars' Lab</a>—began developing customized platforms for Ivanhoe game play. The first mature Ivanhoe Game was played on Henry James's 
<i>The Turn of the Screw</i>. (See an <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100127185313/http://www.speculativecomputing.org/greymatter/ivanhoe/archives/00000036.htm">excerpt</a> 
of the original game.) The players assumed roles, made moves, evaluated each other's moves, assigned points, and kept role journals for reflection. More than simply fan-fiction, 
the game was designed to generate insight into a literary work by asking players to take an active role in the rewriting of the text (see Johanna Drucker and Geoffrey Rockwell, 
<a href="http://texttechnology.mcmaster.ca/pdf/vol12_2_01.pdf">"Reflections on the Ivanhoe Game"</a> in <i>TEXT Technology</i> 2003).
</p>

<p>During the course of its life, the game passed through many stages of development. <!--All past platforms are now defunct. -->At <a href="http://nowviskie.org/2009/sketching-ivanhoe/">its most complex</a>, 
Ivanhoe included elaborate visualizations to provoke game play and analyze networks of moves.</p>

<p>As Ivanhoe became more formally complicated, it also became unwieldy to play, and development on the game was ultimately suspended in 2006. The 2013&ndash;14 Praxis Program 
cohort reimagined Ivanhoe as a WordPress theme, in which players could still assume roles, make moves, respond to others’ moves, and maintain a rationale for roles and moves. 
The work is being carried on by the 2014&ndash;15 cohort, with hopes of adding notification systems, allowing responses to multiple moves, and visualize trajectories of play in order

to make more productive games.</p>
