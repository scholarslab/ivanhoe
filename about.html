<h2>About</h2>
<h3>Connect • Create • Inspire</h3>
<p>Ivanhoe is about making connections, bridging disciplines, and engaging students with an alternative pedagogical approach. This tool allows teachers to transform WordPress into an exciting new environment where students can manipulate and play with a cultural object. Start by inserting a piece of art, a song, a literary text, or even a period of time and let users' imaginations do the rest. See classic novels, movies and traditions transform into new stories, sights, and sounds.</p>
<h3>Old Idea • New Beginnings</h3>
<p>In the spirit of what we have created, our idea is not a new one. It is a modification of the game Ivanhoe that began in 2000 as a light-hearted email exchange between literature scholars Johanna Drucker and Jerome McGann on Sir Walter Scott's novel Ivanhoe, from which the game derives its name. The goal of the game was to intervene directly in the text by adding to the document, reordering the plot, or deleting scenes or characters—all by sending new versions of the text back-and-forth via e-mail. For more on how Ivanhoe works, see Jerome McGann's article <a href="http://www.rc.umd.edu/pedagogies/commons/innovations/IVANHOE.html#session">"IVANHOE: Education in a New Key."</a></p>
<h3>Where we come from</h3>
<p>Soon after Drucker and McGann's email game, Bethany Nowviskie and other vibrant PhD students in the UVa <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/SpecLab.html?id=VPXCk396uPYC">SpecLab</a>—predecessor to the <a href="www.scholarslab.org"></a>Scholars' Lab of today—started developing a platform specifically for Ivanhoe game play. The first mature Ivanhoe game they played was on Henry James' <i>A Turn of the Screw</i>. (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100127185313/http://www.speculativecomputing.org/greymatter/ivanhoe/archives/00000036.htm">See an excerpt of the original game!</a>) The students assumed roles, made moves, evaluated each other's moves, assigned points, and kept role journals for reflection. More than simply fan-fiction, the game was designed to provide the users with insight into a literary work by taking an active role in the rewriting of the text <a href="http://texttechnology.mcmaster.ca/pdf/vol12_2_01.pdf">(Johanna Drucker and Geoffrey Rockwell, "Reflections on the Ivanhoe Game" in <i>TEXT Technology</i>)</a> What they realized was that users could learn while having fun, and from there the game “Ivanhoe” was born.</p>
<p>During the course of its life, the game passed through many stages of development. At its most complex, Ivanhoe included elaborate visualizations by which to analyze game play.</p>

<p>This year's cohort of Praxis Fellows (listed below) took on the Ivanhoe Game and decided to rebuild it as a <a href="wordpress.org">WordPress</a> <a href="http://wordpress.org/themes/">Theme</a>. The idea was to get back to the basics of what Ivanhoe was and make it easier for new players to join.  We also adapted the original Ivanhoe Game's focus on texts, and designed a gaming environment that would encourage multimedia interpretation: using WordPress's default post interface, players can incorporate any type of media they wish into their moves. By expanding the reach of our game to include other media, our goal is to include other disciplines, both inside and out of the humanities.</p>
<h3>Future Directions</h3>
<p>All the burgeoning ideas we have had in the course of thinking about Ivanhoe far surpassed what we could actually build within a year.  Check out our ideas for <a href="future.html">future directions for Ivanhoe!</a></p>
<h3>What is Praxis?</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://praxis.scholarslab.org/">Praxis Program</a> is a year-long fellowship which trains humanities graduate students in conceiving, planning, developing, and designing a digital project.  Members of the Scholars' Lab (listed below) guide the students through the entire process of carrying out the project, giving lessons in coding, digital collaboration, project management, and a myriad of other skills necessary to building a DH tool. Nowviskie refers to the program in <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/A-Digital-Boot-Camp-for-Grad/131665/">her article for the <i>Chronical of Higher Education</i></a>, as a "digital boot camp," and nothing could better describe the program. The Ivanhoe Game WordPress Theme is the culmination of what has been a whirlwind of learning--both in digital skills and collaboration.
