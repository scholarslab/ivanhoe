        <h1>About</h1>
<h2>Connect • Create • Inspire</h2>
<p>The Ivanhoe Game WP Theme is about making connections, bridging disciplines, and engaging students with an alternative pedagogical approach. This Theme allows teachers to convert WordPress into an exciting environment where students can manipulate and play with a cultural object. Start by inserting a piece of art, a song, a literary text, or even a period of time on a static page or post; and let users comment on the topic through WP's easy-to-use blogging interface. See classic novels, movies and traditions transform as users collaboratively react to them using the Ivanhoe Game WP Theme.</p>
<h2>Old Idea • New Beginnings</h2>
<p>In the spirit of what we have created, our idea is not a new one. It is a modification of a game that began in 2000 as a light-hearted email exchange between scholars Johanna Drucker and Jerome McGann on Sir Walter Scott's novel <i>Ivanhoe</i>, from which the game derives its name. The goal of the game was to intervene directly in the text by adding to it, reordering the plot, or deleting scenes or characters—all by sending new versions of the text back and forth via email. For more on how Ivanhoe works, see Jerome McGann's article <a href="http://www.rc.umd.edu/pedagogies/commons/innovations/IVANHOE.html#session">"IVANHOE: Education in a New Key."</a></p>
<p>Soon after Drucker and McGann's email game, Bethany Nowviskie, Nick Laiacona, and other vibrant PhD students in the UVa <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/SpecLab.html?id=VPXCk396uPYC">SpecLab/ARP</a>—one of several precursors to the <a href="http://www.scholarslab.org">Scholars' Lab</a>—started developing a platform specifically for Ivanhoe game play. The first mature Ivanhoe game they played was on Henry James' <i>A Turn of the Screw</i>. (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100127185313/http://www.speculativecomputing.org/greymatter/ivanhoe/archives/00000036.htm">See an excerpt of the original game!</a>) The players assumed roles, made moves, evaluated each other's moves, assigned points, and kept role journals for reflection. More than simply fan-fiction, the game was designed to provide users with insight into a literary work by taking an active role in the rewriting of the text <a href="http://texttechnology.mcmaster.ca/pdf/vol12_2_01.pdf">(Johanna Drucker and Geoffrey Rockwell, "Reflections on the Ivanhoe Game" in <i>TEXT Technology</i>)</a>.</p>
<p>During the course of its life, the game passed through many stages of development. At its most complex, Ivanhoe included elaborate visualizations by which to analyze game play and the networks of moves which it generated.</p>

<h2>The Ivanhoe Game WP Theme</h2>
<p>This year's cohort of Praxis Fellows (listed under "Contributors") took on the Ivanhoe Game and decided to rebuild it as a <a href="wordpress.org">WordPress</a> <a href="http://wordpress.org/themes/">Theme</a>. The idea was to get back to the basics of what Ivanhoe was and make it easier for new players to join.  We also adapted the original Ivanhoe Game's focus on texts and designed a gaming environment that would encourage multimedia interpretation: using WordPress's default post interface, players can incorporate any type of media they wish into their moves. By expanding the reach of our game to include other media, our goal is to include other disciplines, both inside and out of the humanities.</p>

    <h1>What is Praxis?</h1>
    <p>The <a href="http://praxis.scholarslab.org/">Praxis Program</a> is a year-long fellowship which trains humanities graduate students in conceiving, planning, developing, and designing a digital project.  Members of the <a href="www.scholarslab.org">Scholars' Lab</a> (listed below) guide the students through the entire process of carrying out the project, giving lessons in coding, digital collaboration, project management, and a myriad of other skills necessary to building a DH tool. Nowviskie refers to the program in <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/A-Digital-Boot-Camp-for-Grad/131665/">her article for the <i>Chronical of Higher Education</i></a> as a "digital boot camp." The Ivanhoe Game WP Theme is the culmination of what has been a whirlwind of learning--both in digital skills and collaboration.
