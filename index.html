  <h2>Connect • Create • Inspire</h2>
  <p>The Ivanhoe Game is about making connections, bridging disciplines, highlighting subjectivity, and engaging students with an alternative pedagogical approach. This WP Theme allows teachers to convert WordPress, already often used in the classroom, into an exciting environment where students can manipulate and play with a cultural object. Start by inserting a piece of art, a song, a literary text, or even by designating a period of time; ask your students or collaborators to create "roles" from which to comment or add new material; then let them play, using our version of WP's easy blogging interface. See classic stories, movies, artworks, or traditions transform as players collaboratively and creatively react to them within the Ivanhoe Game WP Theme.</p>
