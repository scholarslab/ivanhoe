  <h1>About</h1>
  <h2>Connect • Create • Inspire</h2>
  <p>Ivanhoe is a gateway to collaborative textual play. It transforms WordPress — a familiar blogging tool for learners and teachers — into an environment that encourages reflection and facilitates a critical understanding of cultural objects.</p>
  <p>Ivanhoe is the environment that helps you start the exploration of alternative readings of a text — different versions of a cultural object.</p>
  <p>Choose any cultural object — it could be a book, a diary, a painting, a jazz performance recording, a historical time period. This cultural object will be your ‘text’ for an Ivanhoe game. You will take a ‘role’ in the game and make a 'move’ that offers your own interpretations and re-readings of the text from a particular perspective. Through your moves, you will also explore the interpretations of others as well as how they shape the chosen cultural object and the game. </p>

<h1>Why Play Ivanhoe Games</h1>
<p>Ivanhoe games help you reflect on your own readings of a text as well as on the readings of others. As you reflect, you reveal different versions of the chosen text, and others playing with you also learn about alternatives or versions hidden, silenced, neglected, forgotten, or previously unimaginable. You may inspire revisions to existing readings or even new readings of the same text. Ivanhoe allows you to collaborate towards a new understanding of a text through play.</p> 
<p>Ivanhoe games encourages learning through textual interpretation, reflection, performance, and collaboration. It is about making connections, bridging disciplines, highlighting subjectivity, and engaging players.</p>
<h2>Collaboration • Reflection • Performativity</h2>
<p>The layout of Ivanhoe reflects our commitment to three principles: collaboration, reflection, and performativity.</p>
<p>Collaboration is fundamental to the mechanics of Ivanhoe gameplay. An Ivanhoe game involves multiple players who respond to the central cultural object and also to each other. Players work together to weave a discursive web around the central text of the game and draw meaning out of the text <i>in relation to each others' responses</i>.</p>
<p>Reflection is also written into the mechanics of Ivanhoe gameplay. It is what distinguishes Ivanhoe from other forms of collaborative writing and solitary reflection like fan fiction, forums and comments sections on blogs. Players are required to reflect on the moves they make through the vantage point of their role in the game. The primary means through which Ivanhoe encourages reflection is through the requirement that players keep a journal about their role. The journal is separate from gameplay itself. It allows players to reflect on their choices for a move and also the relationship of their move to the moves of fellow players. The role journal provides a space dedicated to learning from self-reflection as well as reflection about others.</p>
<p>Performativity refers to the importance of roleplay in Ivanhoe games. Ivanhoe requires players to make moves and have a stake in the game as a particular character. Players create their roles for themselves at the beginning of the game and they are expected to 'perform' those roles for the duration of the game. This makes them delve deeply into the implications of a given critical perspective, a particular location and a point of view. This is what makes Ivanhoe games fun: you learn a lot about multiple interpretations of a text and understand better a particular cultural object!</p>

<h1>Ivanhoe as Work in Progress</h1>
<p> Ivanhoe has experienced a series of transformations, as concept as well as software. Its trajectory reflects the work of several scholars, the collaboration of different institutions, and the engagement of many disciplinary communities through time.</p>
<h2>Old Idea • New Beginnings</h2>
<p>Ivanhoe builds on the past. The name comes from Sir Walter Scott's novel <i>Ivanhoe</i> which was the cultural object of interest at the center of the first game played in the year 2000 by scholars Johanna Drucker and Jerome McGann. The initial goal of the game was to uncover alternative narratives and readings by intervening directly in the text: adding to it, reordering the plot, or deleting scenes or characters. The first version of the game was played by sending new versions of the text back and forth via email. For more on how Ivanhoe works, see a 2004 article by McGann, Drucker, and Nowviskie: <a href="http://www.rc.umd.edu/pedagogies/commons/innovations/IVANHOE.html#session">"IVANHOE: Education in a New Key."</a></p>
<p>The concept caught on, and soon dozens of Ivanhoe Games were being played at the University of Virginia and <a href="http://texttechnology.mcmaster.ca/pdf/vol12_2_04.pdf">elsewhere</a>. Faculty, graduate students, and software developers at UVa's <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/SpecLab.html?id=VPXCk396uPYC">SpecLab</a> think-tank and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applied_Research_in_Patacriticism">ARP lab</a>—two precursors to the UVa Library <a href="http://praxis.scholarslab.org">Praxis Program</a> and <a href="http://www.scholarslab.org">Scholars' Lab</a>—began developing customized platforms for Ivanhoe game play. The first mature Ivanhoe Game was played on Henry James' <i>The Turn of the Screw</i>. (See an <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20100127185313/http://www.speculativecomputing.org/greymatter/ivanhoe/archives/00000036.htm">excerpt</a> of the original game!) The players assumed roles, made moves, evaluated each other's moves, assigned points, and kept role journals for reflection. More than simply fan-fiction, the game was designed to generate insight into a literary work by asking players to take an active role in the rewriting of the text (see Drucker and Rockwell, <a href="http://texttechnology.mcmaster.ca/pdf/vol12_2_01.pdf">"Reflections on the Ivanhoe Game"</a> in <i>TEXT Technology</i> 2003).</p>
<p>During the course of its life, the game passed through many stages of development. At <a href="http://nowviskie.org/2009/sketching-ivanhoe/">its most complex</a>, Ivanhoe included elaborate visualizations to provoke game play and analyze networks of moves.</p>
 <a href="http://nowviskie.org/2009/sketching-ivanhoe/"><img src="http://nowviskie.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/treesstars.jpg"></a>
<p>As Ivanhoe became more complicated, it also became unwieldy to play, and development on the game was ultimately suspended in 2006.</p>
<p>The Ivanhoe you will play in has been the project of two interdisciplinary groups of graduate students in the <a href="http://praxis.scholarslab.org">Praxis Program</a> (see description below). The 2013–14 Praxis Program cohort (see list of fellows below) reimagined Ivanhoe as a WordPress theme, in which players could still assume roles, make moves, respond to others’ moves, and maintain a rationale for roles and moves. The work was carried on by the 2014–15 cohort (see list of fellows below) who added email notifications for moves and responding to multiple moves, in order to make playing Ivanhoe games more fun.</p>
<h2>Contribute to Ivanhoe</h2>
<p>Ivanhoe is work-in-progress. As the <a href="http://praxis.scholarslab.org">Praxis Program</a> operates in the spirit of open-source development, we have made all our <a href="https://github.com/scholarslab/ivanhoe">files and source code</a> available on GitHub. We would love your feedback! Feel free to take a look, see what makes Ivanhoe work, and contribute code or <a href="https://github.com/scholarslab/ivanhoe/issues">your ideas</a> for its improvement by  issues to our <a href="https://github.com/scholarslab/ivanhoe/issues?state=open">GitHub page</a>.</p>

<h2>What is the Praxis Program?</h2>
  <p>The <a href="http://praxis.scholarslab.org/">Praxis Program</a> is a year-long fellowship at the <a href="http://library.virginia.edu">University of Virginia Library</a> that supports a team of humanities graduate students in conceiving, planning, developing, and designing a digital project.  The faculty and staff of the Library's <a href="http://scholarslab.org">Scholars' Lab</a> (listed below) guide Praxis Fellows through the entire process, mentoring in software design and development, collaboration, project management, and a myriad of other skills necessary to build tools for humanities interpretation. Program founder Bethany Nowviskie refers to Praxis in <a href="http://libra.virginia.edu/catalog/libra-oa:699">an invited essay</a> for the <i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i> as a "no ordinary humanities seminar." The Ivanhoe WP Theme is the culmination of a whirlwind of learning for the 2013-14 and 2014-15 cohorts — both in digital skills and in interdisciplinary collaboration. For more on the experience of building Ivanhoe, <a href="http://praxis.scholarslab.org/">visit our blog</a>.</p>
