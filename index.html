<h1>What is Ivanhoe</h1>
<p>In Ivanhoe, players take on roles within or around a shared text. Through those roles, players embody a position within that text, and by making moves from that position, expose myriad adjacent possibles within a text. Ivanhoe grew out of dissatisfaction: a dissatisfaction with limitations inherent in existing forms of interpreting texts, where readers felt the need for “a more imaginative form wanted to develop a more imaginative form of critical methodology.”</p>

  <p>The <a href="http://praxis.scholarslab.org/">Praxis Program</a> is a year-long fellowship at the <a href="http://library.virginia.edu">University of Virginia Library</a> that supports a team of humanities graduate students in conceiving, planning, developing, and designing a digital project.  The faculty and staff of the Library's <a href="www.scholarslab.org">Scholars' Lab</a> guide Praxis Fellows through the entire process, mentoring in software design and development, collaboration, project management, and a myriad of other skills necessary to build tools for humanities interpretation. Program founder Bethany Nowviskie refers to Praxis in <a href="http://libra.virginia.edu/catalog/libra-oa:699">an invited essay</a> for the <i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i> as a "no ordinary humanities seminar." The Ivanhoe Game WP Theme is the culmination of a whirlwind of learning for the 2013-14 cohort—both in digital skills and in interdisciplinary collaboration.
