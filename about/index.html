<h1>About Ivanhoe</h1>

<p> Ivanhoe is <b> a gateway to collaborative textual play </b>. It transforms WordPress&mdash;a familiar blogging tool for many learners and teachers&mdash;into an environment that asks for reflection during and after play to encourage rethinking of cultural creations. </p>

<h2> Explore • Reveal • Inspire </h2>

 <p> Pick up any cultural object you want to learn about - a pen, a book, a diary, a painting, a tune, a jazz performance recording, a historical time period. This cultural object will be your <i>‘text’</i> and you will <b>‘play'</b> with it continuously  &mdash; offering your own <i>‘reading'/interpretation</i> of the text and exploring the readings of others. Ivanhoe is the environment that helps you start the <i>exploration</i> of alternative readings of a text &mdash; different shades of a cultural object under different lenses. Ivanhoe helps you <b>‘reflect'</b> on your own readings as well as on the readings of others. As you reflect, you <i>‘reveal'</i> different versions of a chosen ’text’ and others playing with you also learn about alternatives or versions hidden, silenced, neglected, forgotten or unimaginable for some time. You may end up <i>inspiring</i> revisions to existing readings or even new readings of the same text. That is how you all <b>‘collaborate'</b> through play in better understanding the cultural object you are interested in. </p>

<p>Ivanhoe is a <i>gateway</i> not a platform or place, because it encourages you to create the boundaries of your space through play. Collaboration is an <i>emergent</i> feature of play which is enabled by an environment that requires reflection on one’s and others’ readings. Your readings are called ‘moves’ in Ivanhoe as they express your subjectivity as well as your active participation in play. Through Ivanhoe, you look at your cultural object differently &mdash; reading your text through multiple lenses. At some point, you find yourself playing a <i>‘game'</i> &mdash; with some bounded space, ‘roles', rules and trajectory. This game emerged through time with the help of Ivanhoe and your moves. Ivanhoe helped you take advantage of the <i>fluidity</i> of play. It enabled <i>learning</i> about the cultural object of their interest by asking for careful <i>reflection on oneself and others</i> throughout play.</p>

<p>Ivanhoe encourages learning through textual interpretation, reflection, performance, and collaboration. It is about making connections, bridging disciplines, highlighting subjectivity, and engaging players. It has been the project of two interdisciplinary groups of graduate students in the <a href="http://praxis.scholarslab.org"/>Praxis Program</a>. The 2013&ndash;14 Praxis cohort took on the development of Ivanhoe at the Scholars’ Lab, and we, in the present cohort of 2014&ndash;15, are continuing their work.  </p>
