	<h1>About Ivanhoe</h1>
	<h2>Interpretation ᐧ Collaboration ᐧ Performance ᐧ Reflection</h2>

	<p>Ivanhoe is a gateway to textual interpretation and reflection. It enables and is enabled by play. It is collaborative; it is performative. Every text has an infinite number of possibilities within it, and when we put our heads together, we can excavate some of these, and reveal things hitherto hidden, neglected, silenced, forgotten, unimaginable. Everyone playing the game performs a “role” in relation to the text, and to fellow players. Reflection is embedded in this process of role creation, responding to others’ “moves,” and, in the final instance, in the journal all players maintain through the course of the game.</p>

<p>
The game is about making connections, bridging disciplines, highlighting subjectivity, and engaging players with an alternative pedagogical approach. The game transforms WordPress - a familiar blogging tool for many learners and teachers - into an exciting environment that enables players to rethink a text, whether a literary creation or other cultural object, through collaborative play(fulness). Start by inserting a piece of art, a song, a literary text, or even by designating a period of time; ask other collaborators to contribute new material and perform "roles" within the scope of this initial inspiration; then let them play, using our easy blogging interface to explore the contents and push the limitations of the given text. Players will engage collaboratively and creatively with classic stories, movies, artworks, or traditions to uncover alternative, undeveloped, and previously unconsidered elements within this Ivanhoe Game WP Theme. </p>

<p>
	Ivanhoe has been the project of two interdisciplinary groups of graduate students in the <a href=http://praxis.scholarslab.org/>Praxis Program</a>. The 2013-2014 Praxis cohort took on the development of Ivanhoe at the Scholars’ Lab, and we, in the present cohort of 2014-15, are continuing their work.</p>
