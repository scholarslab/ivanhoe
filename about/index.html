<h1>About Ivanhoe</h1>

<p>Ivanhoe is <b> a gateway to collaborative textual play</b>. It transforms WordPress&mdash;a familiar blogging tool for many learners and teachers&mdash;into an environment that 
encourages reflection during and after play to facilitate the rethinking of cultural artefacts. </p>

<!-- not sure about the headlines--> 
<h2> Explore • Reveal • Inspire </h2>

<p>Choose any cultural object&mdash;a book, a diary, a painting, a jazz performance recording, a historical time period. This cultural object will be your ‘text’ for a round of Ivanhoe. You will 
offer your own interpretations and re-readings of the text and explore the interpretations of others. Ivanhoe is the environment that helps you start the exploration of alternative readings
of a text &mdash; different shades of a cultural object under different lenses. Ivanhoe helps you reflect on your own readings as well as on the readings of others. As you reflect, you reveal 
different versions of a chosen text, and others playing with you also learn about alternatives or versions hidden, silenced, neglected, forgotten, or previously unimaginable.
You may inspire revisions to existing readings or even new readings of the same text. Ivanhoe allows you to collaborate towards a new understanding of a text through play. </p>

<p>Ivanhoe is a <i>gateway</i> not a platform or place, because it encourages you to create the boundaries of your space through play. Collaboration is an <i>emergent</i> feature of play which is enabled by an environment that requires reflection on one’s and others’ readings. Your readings are called ‘moves’ in Ivanhoe as they express your subjectivity as well as your active participation in play. Through Ivanhoe, you look at your cultural object differently &mdash; reading your text through multiple lenses. At some point, you find yourself playing a <i>‘game'</i> &mdash; with some bounded space, ‘roles', rules and trajectory. This game emerged through time with the help of Ivanhoe and your moves. Ivanhoe helped you take advantage of the <i>fluidity</i> of play. It enabled <i>learning</i> about the cultural object of their interest by asking for careful <i>reflection on oneself and others</i> throughout play.</p>

<p>Ivanhoe encourages learning through textual interpretation, reflection, performance, and collaboration. It is about making connections, bridging disciplines, highlighting subjectivity, and engaging players. It has been the project of two interdisciplinary groups of graduate students in the <a href="http://praxis.scholarslab.org"/>Praxis Program</a>. The 2013&ndash;14 Praxis cohort took on the development of Ivanhoe at the Scholars’ Lab, and we, in the present cohort of 2014&ndash;15, are continuing their work.  </p>
