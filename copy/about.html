	<h1>About Ivanhoe</h1>
	<h2>Interpretation ᐧ Collaboration ᐧ Performance ᐧ Reflection</h2>

	<p class="contentp">Ivanhoe is a gateway to textual interpretation and reflection. It enables and is enabled by play. It is collaborative; it is performative. Every text has an infinite number of possibilities within it, and when we put our heads together, we can excavate some of these, and reveal things hitherto hidden, neglected, silenced, forgotten, unimaginable. Everyone playing the game performs a “role” in relation to the text, and to fellow players. Reflection is embedded in this process of role creation, responding to others’ “moves,” and, in the final instance, in the journal all players maintain through the course of the game.</p>

	<p class="contentp">The game is about making connections, bridging disciplines, highlighting subjectivity, and engaging players with an alternative pedagogical approach. This WP Theme allows teachers to convert WordPress, already often used in the classroom, into an exciting environment where students can manipulate and play with a cultural object. Start by inserting a piece of art, a song, a literary text, or even by designating a period of time; ask other collaborators to create "roles" from which to comment or add new material; then let them play, using our version of WP's easy blogging interface. See classic stories, movies, artworks, or traditions transform as players collaboratively and creatively react to them within the Ivanhoe Game WP Theme. The game transforms WordPress - a familiar blogging tool for many learners and teachers - into an exciting environment that encourages rethinking of stories and cultural creations through collaborative play(fulness).</p>

	<p class="contentp">Ivanhoe has been the project of two interdisciplinary groups of graduate students in the <a href=http://praxis.scholarslab.org/>Praxis Program</a>. The 2013-2014 Praxis cohort took on the development of Ivanhoe at the Scholars’ Lab, and we, in the present cohort of 2014-15, are continuing their work.</p>
