	<h1>History of Ivanhoe</h1>

	<p>Ivanhoe began in the year 2000 as a light-hearted email exchange between scholars Johanna Drucker and Jerome McGann, on Sir Walter Scott's novel Ivanhoe, from which the game derives its name. The goal of the game was to uncover alternative narratives and readings by intervening directly in the text: adding to it, reordering the plot, or deleting scenes or characters. The first version of the game was played by sending new versions of the text back and forth via email.</p>

	<p>As others picked up the game—faculty, grad students, and software engineers alike, at UVA and elsewhere—they began developing customized platforms for Ivanhoe play that would encourage players to generate new insights by actively rewriting a given text, such as Henry James’ The Turn of the Screw. Players assumed roles, made moves, evaluated each other's moves, assigned points, and kept role journals for reflection. At its most complex, Ivanhoe included elaborate visualizations to provoke game play and analyze networks of moves.</p>

	<p>As Ivanhoe became more formally complicated, it also became unwieldy to play, and development on the game was ultimately suspended around 2006. The 2013–14 Praxis Program cohort reimagined Ivanhoe as a WordPress theme, in which players could still assume roles, make moves, respond to others’ moves, and maintain a rationale for roles and moves alike. The work is being carried on by the 2014–15 cohort, with hopes of adding notification systems, allowing responses to multiple moves, and drawing on past visualizations to design an interface well-suited to contemporary gaming habits.</p>

	The present version of Ivanhoe is being developed and maintained by the <a href=http://praxis.scholarslab.org/>Praxis Program</a>. We’re a cohort of graduate students brought together by the University of Virginia Scholars’ Lab to build digital skills and prepare for emergent academic and alt-ac careers.
	
	This year’s cohort (2014–15) is the second to work on Ivanhoe, and the fourth overall—see our sister program <a href=http://prism.scholarslab.org/>Prism</a> for the work carried out by the first two cohorts.
