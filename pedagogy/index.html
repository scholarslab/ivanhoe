		<h1>Ivanhoe and Pedagogy</h1>

		<p>Ivanhoe has hitherto been theorized and used as a pedagogical aid. In 2004, Jerome McGann promoted Ivanhoe as a way to “to promote rigorous as well as imaginative thinking; to develop habits of thoroughness and flexibility when we investigate our cultural inheritance and try to exploit its sources and resources; and to expose and promote the collaborative dynamics of all humane studies.” The role-play aspect of the Ivanhoe experience is critical to meet these objectives, for role play requires students to reinterpret a cultural text through collaborative performance and reflection. By self-consciously embodying an element in the text, students must internalize and synthesize (rather than summarize) aspects of the story, apply relevant theory or historical context, and evaluate their moves in relationship to those of other players. While the use of roles and moves facilitates the performance of a student's role, Ivanhoe’s unique role journal encourages students to reflect upon their moves, motivations, and interpretations.</p>

		<p>There are a number of pedagogical guides that embrace not only play, but specifically role-play as way to engage and motivate students in diverse fields and settings. Below, we have included some recent publications that explore the theoretical underpinnings of educational play, as well as examples of successful role-play assignments.</p>
