<!--- I think it is better if we add this content to the History page and not have a separate page on Pedagogy. Why are we prioritizing the Classroom - this limits the attention of certain users and limits accessibility of Ivanhoe .J.GJ. -->

<h1>The Concept and Use of Ivanhoe</h1>
Ivanhoe has been envisaged as a <b>learning environment</b>. It has been used a lot in classrooms, as a pedagogical tool. Debate is ongoing on its purpose and possible uses outside the classroom. 

<h2> In the classroom • Beyond the classroom </h2>
	
<p>Ivanhoe has been mainly theorized and used as a <b>pedagogical aid</b>. In 2004, Jerome McGann recognized Ivanhoe as a way “to promote rigorous as well as imaginative thinking; to develop habits of thoroughness and flexibility when we investigate our cultural inheritance and try to exploit its sources and resources; and to expose and promote the collaborative dynamics of all humane studies...The role-play aspect of the Ivanhoe experience is critical to meet these objectives, for role-play requires students to reinterpret a cultural text through collaborative performance and reflection. By self consciously embodying an element in the text, students must internalize and synthesize (rather than summarize) aspects of the story, apply relevant theory or historical context, and evaluate their moves in relationship to those of other players. While the use of roles and moves facilitates the performance of a student's role, Ivanhoe’s unique role journal encourages students to reflect upon their moves, motivations, and interpretations." Even though McGann gives examples of Ivanhoe's use in the classroom, his statement shows that the purpose of Ivanhoe can be more broadly defined as <i> enabling </i> learning, which is <b>not necessarily limited to the classroom.</b></p>

<p> <i>Pedagogical guides</i> that embrace not only play, but specifically <i>role-play</i> as a way to engage and motivate students in diverse fields and settings are numerous. Below, we have included some recent publications that explore the theoretical underpinnings of <b>educational play</b>, as well as examples of successful role-play assignments. </p> 

<p> These articles remind us also that the <b>debate</b> on the concept of Ivanhoe, its purposes and uses, is an ongoing process. There is more work to do on Ivanhoe <i>beyond</i> the classroom. </p>
